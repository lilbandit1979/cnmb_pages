Dear colleagues, 
	COVID has ruled the roost over our Cumann na mBunscol activities and it is fair to say that the school children of Kildare have really missed putting on the school jersey. We are awaiting direction from our Cumann Náisiúnta for the coming school year. Until then please encourage the children to participate locally and enjoy their games . We hope every teacher enjoys a well earned Summer break.
