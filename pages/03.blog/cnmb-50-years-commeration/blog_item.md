Dear Cumann na mBunscol Coordinator,
   Cumann na mBunscol as we know it was founded in 1971 and will mark 50 years in existence next year. Although the current pandemic has put many events on hold, Cumann na mBunscol plans to compile and publish a book to mark the development of Gaelic Games in primary schools over the course of the last half century. Joe Lyons and Ciarán Crowe from Limerick have agreed to take on this task. Both have been involved in Cumann na mBunscol for well over 30 years. Joe is currently a member of an Coiste Náisiúnta and Ciarán is PRO of Cumann na mBunscol Luimnigh. 

   Cumann na  mBunscol started in Kildare in 1990. President of Cumann na mBunscol Chill Dara, Maurice Musgrave is putting together our contribution to the book. To this end he  is seeking photographs of former Cumann na mBunscol  players from schools around the county who have gone on to “ star” in various roles in society be it sport , politics, entertainment, business etc.  Any photographs can be forwarded to:

If these photographs could be forwarded by May bank holiday weekend it would a great help to Maurice. Thanking you in advance

Seán Corkery
