             Large schools league: schools with &gt; 125 Students eligible (3rd to 6th)

1. 10 players or more if you wish per team, not necessarily the same 10 players for every game.
2. For large and intermediate sized schools you must play 5 on, 5 off for the first two quarters. This means you play 5 players in the first quarter and a different 5 players in the second quarter. For the last two quarters you play whoever you wish and sub on and off as often as you wish to. If you don&#39;t have 10 players you will have to forfeit the game.
3. All games will consist of 4 quarters at 7min per quarter.
4. Must play half court man-to-man defence (no zone). Press or full court defence allowed for last quarter of game.
5. Violations such as travelling and double dribble to be fully enforced. No backcourt violation. No 3 pointers.
6. Every game begins with a jump ball. After that all jump ball situations have been replaced by alternate possession (alternate teams inbound from the sideline).
7. Team fouls must be recorded along with score. Once a team commits 4 team fouls in a quarter each foul after that will entitle the opposition to 2 free throws.
8. When shooting into 10 foot rings free throws should be taken from the broken circle inside the key.
9. Sidelines and baselines on the court must be clearly marked.
10. Home teams must supply a referee (with knowledge of the rules of basketball ) and away teams are encouraged to bring a referee with the team.
11. Reports with scores must be furnished to Joe O&#39;Connor ( 0863705488) or 045-432446(S) ) by the manager of the winning team not later than 7 days after the game. In the past several teams have not bothered to phone in results thus leading to confusion.
12. Any games not played before semi-final date will not be considered. The side unable to field a team will forfeit the game.
13. Semi-finals will be played on a home and away basis: best combined score wins.(team that wins their section will have home advantage for the second leg of semi final)
