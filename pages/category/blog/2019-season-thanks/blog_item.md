## Summer Season 2019 ##

A chairde,
 	Sincere thanks to all our schools, mentors and children for their participation in our Summer 2019 season. Over 40 finals in boys football, girls football, u10 football, senior hurling and camogie were played over the past few weeks with a huge number of children taking part. None of this would happen without teachers giving their time to train and organise all the little things that go into playing a game. 
    On behalf of Cumann na mBunscol Kildare we wish you an enjoyable and restful Summer and look forward to seeing you all on the playing pitches for the Under 11 Season in September. 
    
    Le meas,
    Stephen O Brien.
