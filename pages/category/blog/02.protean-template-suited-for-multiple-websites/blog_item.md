A Chairde
<p>The Allianz Cumann na mBunscol Kildare Quiz will take place on Wednesday 8th of March in Ballymany Senior School. Schools taking part are asked to send one team of 4 pupils. The quiz is open to any child attending primary school. First Question will be asked at 10.45 sharp and we would ask for schools to arrive early to register for the event. As space in the hall is limited we would ask  that 1 mentor only stay with each team during the quiz. Tea, coffee and light refreshments will be served on the day. </p>
<p>The schools registered to take part are; Curragh Boys, Ballyshannon, Kilmead, Kildare, Prosperous, St Josephs Kilcock, Rathcoffey, Ballymany, Coill Dubh, Suncroft, Milltown, Ballysax, Twomilehouse, JTB, Kilshanroe, Scoil Mochua, Kill, Patricians, St Pats Newbridge, Caragh, Rathmore, Scoil Phadraig Naofa Athy, Scoil Mhicil Naofa Athy, Ardclough, Maynooth Boys, Scoil Ui Riada, Allen, Allenwood Boys, Naas CNS, Kilcullen and Castledermot.
