# 2018 Thanks! #

Cumann na mBunscol Kildare would like to sincerely thank all of our member schools for participating in our 2017/18 season. We would also like to express our appreciation to all of the teachers who agreed to umpire and help out on finals days.
 We wish all of our teachers a lovely Summer and a well earned break. See you all on the playing pitches in September!
