A Chairde

The Allianz Cumann na mBunscol quiz will take place on Friday February 23rd in Ballymany Senior School, first question 10.45 sharp. Each competing school is asked to send 1 team of 4 children. There are no age limits and is open to any child in your school. There is no entry fee.  As space in the hall is limited we would ask that only 1 teacher/adult stay with the team during the quiz. The following schools are registered to take part; 

Rathmore, Rathcoffey, Clane Girls, St Pats Newbridge, Caragh, Clogherinkoe, Scoil Bhride Naas, St Corbans Naas, Kilmead, Kildare, Ballymany, Ballyshannon, Scoil Mhicil Naofa, Ardclough, Churchtown, Allen, Castledermot, Celbridge, Twomilehouse, Newbridge Educate Together, Kilcullen, Maynooth Boys, Ballysax, Straffan, Scoil Ui Riada, Suncroft, Robertstown, Conleths & Marys, Allenwood, Patricians, Coill Dubh, Kill, Prosperous, Naas Community School, Milltown, Scoil Phradraig Athy and Curragh Boys. 

If any other school was omitted or would like to be added to the list please contact Paul Dunning 0857040603. 

The 1st question will be asked at 10.45 so we would stress the importance of being on time.

Good luck to all schools. 

The Committee.
