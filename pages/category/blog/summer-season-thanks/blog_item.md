A chairde,
 Sincere thanks to all Cumann na mBunscol teachers who mentored teams during our Summer season. Hundreds of children took park in Gaelic Games across the county culminating in our football, camogie and hurling finals. We hope that you enjoy a well earnerd break over the Summer and look forward to seeing you all once again on the playing pitches in September.
