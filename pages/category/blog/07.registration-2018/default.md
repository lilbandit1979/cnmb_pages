2018 registration has been brought forward to December to:
* Allow the committee more time to assign divisions and fixtures.

* <p>Cumann na mBunscol Kildare would like to sincerely thank all of our members for giving their time and hard work year in, year out. We look to seeing you all on the playing pitches in the new year.</p>
