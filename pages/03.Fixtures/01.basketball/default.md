For the last two quarters you play whoever you wish and sub on and off as often as you wish to. If you don’t have 10 players you will have to forfeit the game.
3. All games will consist of 4 quarters at 7min per quarter.
4. Must play half court man-to-man defence (no zone). Press or full court defence allowed for last quarter of game.

6. Every game begins with a jump ball. After that all jump ball situations have been replaced by alternate possession (alternate teams inbound from the sideline).
